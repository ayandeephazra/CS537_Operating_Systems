y has done all command except for d,key. some of the commands do not update the databse values in the end. 

z is very buggy, delete does not work, clear does not work, new file not made
z does not put elements onto empty file, but can put elements onto used file

a is a dumpster fire

b is just y

./b p,45,haley p,35,martin p,30,arbitha p,25,hansen p,195,mark

./b p,46,liam p,44,sanders p,59,leonard p,21,merc 

b completely does everything in p,g,c,a just d is left
